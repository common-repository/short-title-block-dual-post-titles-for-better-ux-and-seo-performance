**The Problem**

In the world of content creation, a blog post title must serve two masters with conflicting objectives. Its primary role is to clearly communicate to readers and search engines what the post is about. However, when long, keyword-rich titles are displayed on archive pages or in query loops, they are too long, dare I say clunky, and what helps a search engine or reader isn’t likely to engage or entice visitors to click through.

**The Solution**

The Short Title Block plugin resolves this conflict by giving you the flexibility to add a short, enticing title to posts. This short title can be used on archive pages and in query loops.

Using a short title in this way will significantly improve click-through rates and overall engagement in query loops and on archive pages without compromising the primary purpose of your post titles.

The plugin also adds an additional control to the Title block that lets you choose the short title.

But what happens if you don’t add a Short Title to your post?

No worries. The plugin has logic in place to use the default title if the Short Title is not available.

Review the screenshot for detailed “How-To” instructions for the plugin.

**Short Title Block - Features and Benefits**

-	**Dual-Title Functionality**: Easily add a short title in addition to your primary title—the ideal use case is archive pages and query loops.
-	**Enhanced Click-Through Rates**: Craft short titles that captivate and encourage visitors to explore your content further.
-	**Improved User Experience**: You no longer need to compromise on the default title’s ability to communicate the purpose of post or page content to readers or search engines to accommodate the limited space available in the archive or query loop cards.
-	**SEO Optimization**: Maintain clear, keyword-rich primary titles for search engine indexing while utilizing short titles for improved user engagement.
-	**Conditional Logic**: If a short title isn't available, the default title will automatically be used, ensuring consistent display without additional effort.

Upgrade your WordPress site with the Short Title Block plugin and experience the perfect balance between clarity and engagement in your titles.

Transform how your content is presented and drive more engagement.
